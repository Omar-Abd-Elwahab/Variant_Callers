# Variant_Callers
we are addressing the question of whether there is an advantage of a specific variant calling tool over others using a different type of sequencing data (i.e., short vs. long reads)
Especially with the emergence of AI-based variant calling tools, there has been an intriguing question of their potential to supersede conventional ones for calling SNPs and INDELs using long and short reads
Most of the conventional variant calling tools have been developed for short-read analysis, and they have been widely used over the years
However, some of them were not tested against data from new sequencing technologies like HiFi and ONT.
